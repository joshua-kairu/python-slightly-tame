# Exercises for Think Python

## Introduction :point_up:

There's a very interesting PDF guide to [Python] online called [Think Python]. So far I have found it a simple, straightforward, *open-source* way to learn the snake-like language.

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book. Comments are very welcome.

## How To Use :wrench:

:zero: Ensure you have `python` installed in your system. I used `python 3.6` in a Linux environment. For coding, I used a text editor: [Kate].

:one: Direct your terminal to the directory holding the exercises.

:two: In the terminal, type:

```
$ python name-of-file.py
```

For example, if the file you want to run is ex-3-3-len.py, you should have this in your terminal:

```
$ python ex-3-3-len.py
```

## Abilities :muscle:

* Implements exercises in Think Python

## Limitations :worried:

* Does not explain how snake-charming works :snake:

## Possible Future Work :fast_forward:

- [ ] Finish the exercises

## Other things :books:

* Thanks to Allen Downey for this guide. :smile:
